# Julien-capstone-project
Python project using python 101 techniques 

Purpose/Problem Statement - What does your program do? What problem/need is it addressing? The purpose of my code was using the DND api to make a DnD program. A problem I ran into was pulling information from the DnD api to allow the user to access to

Target Audience - Who is this for? (ex: students, gamers, DnD API Program)

Purpose/Problem Statement The purpose of this project is to build a program that utilizes the Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) API to provide users with easy access to essential information about the game. The program helps new players understand different classes, races, and game mechanics by pulling data from the DnD API. One challenge I encountered was pulling data from the API in a way that ensures smooth user interaction and accessibility of relevant information.

Target Audience This program is designed for new Dungeons & Dragons players who want to learn more about the gameâ€™s mechanics, including its classes, races, and other features. It can also serve as a helpful tool for experienced players looking for quick access to game data.

Solution + Limitations This program solves the problem by giving users access to detailed information about the various classes, races, and rules of DnD. However, there are some limitations, such as not being able to retrieve all available information from the API or offering advanced features like character creation and integration with live campaigns. The program is intended to be a starting point for new players to explore and learn about the game.

Key Features / Key Components Class & Race Information: Provides detailed descriptions of DnD classes and races.
Game Mechanics: Offers access to basic game mechanics and how they work.
Interactive User Interface: Allows users to query the API and receive responses about the game's features.

Technical Challenges + Future Plans A major challenge in developing this program was dealing with the complexity of the DnD API and ensuring data was accurately parsed and displayed. Some areas for future improvement include:
Allowing users to save their preferences for quick access to frequently used data.
Implementing user accounts and customizable settings.

Tools and Resources Used DnD API Documentation: Official documentation to understand the API endpoints and data structure.
I mainly did this for my unit 5 project, and for my personal use 

Solution + Limitations - How does your project solve the problem?  
It allows new DND user's to have knowledge of what D&D is and the different classes and races Key Features / Key Components 

Technical Challenges + Future Plans - What was hard to figure out? What do you wish you could add if you had more time or more experience? Pulling information from the given DnD api

Project Timeline - Briefly explain how you broke this project up across days.

Project Timeline This project was broken down into the following phases:
day 1: Familiarizing with the DnD API and understanding the available data.

day 2: Building the basic structure of the program and integrating the API.

day 3: Implementing the user interface and testing.

day 4: Finalizing the program, fixing bugs, and preparing for the unit 5 project submission.
